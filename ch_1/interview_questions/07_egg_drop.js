/* Egg drop.
 * Suppose that you have an N-story building (with floors 1 through N)
 * and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T of higher
 * and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine
 * the value of T given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:
 * - Version 0: 1 egg <= T tosses
 * - Version 1: ~1lgN eggs and ~1lgN tosses
 * - Version 2: ~lgT eggs and ~2lgT tosses
 * - Version 3: 2 eggs and ~2sqrtN tosses
 * - Version 4: 2 eggs and <= c sqrtT tosses for some fixed constant c
